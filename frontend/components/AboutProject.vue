            Welcome to Binary Trails! The goal is simple: challenge your coding and problem-solving skills through three exciting phases. This project is meant to be a fun way for developers to engage in hands-on tasks like working with APIs, decoding encrypted messages, and solving algorithm challenges. It's not about leaderboards or statsâ€”just you, the challenges, and a bit of fun.
